# Variation-AutoEncoder
This project aims to generate new images from training dataset. Dataset can be downloaded from http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html.


VAE are generative model different from basic autoencoder these model not only uses a function to represent given input on a compressed representation but also uses predictive approach to generate new images. Vae uses the probability distribution of the given data to genrate the newer images by sampling the current distribution of the data.



Note: I have tried two different cases by first considering nly grayscale value and then the colored inputs to test the modle'output.
reusult1.png is the result for grayscale model and result4.png for colored model.
